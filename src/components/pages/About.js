    <p>HOW I BECAME A SOFTWARE TESTER :
    <p>----------------------------------------------------</p></p>A long time ago, in a galaxy far far awayâ€¦Sorry..Actually not very long ago,
  4 years from now I was working as a manual Quality Assurance software tester at "Mshah Info Technologies".My colleague 
  and myself were doing the test execution manually and the project required lots of regression because the application 
  depended on multiple web services and new features were added to the application every now and then,
   which made the process even more cumbersome to carry out manually..It was then that I decided to try 
   my hand on automating the test cases which required multiple data entries on multiple browsers, 
   I did fairly well(with help from online youtube tutorials). After the project closure ,
   I took up more professional training and certifications in Selinium and Java. I have configured, designed, 
   executed and maintained Selenium Test Environment (STE) ,Automated the design of a framework(TestNG).Created, 
   enhanced, debugged, and ran the test cases,Collated and monitored the defect management process working 
   for "SynergyTech".... My tip for aspiring Automation testers would be - (For Selenium WebDriver) Learn a programming language. 
   If possible, use the same language that developers use in your team (e.g. if Java is used within the company, you should develop a test 
  automation framework and test scripts using the same language). </p></h4>;
