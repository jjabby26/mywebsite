  <p>I am often confronted with the problem of having too many abilities in too many areas in which I would like to work, discover and excel.</p>
  Sometimes I am overwhelmed by the pressure of my creativity,it is a drive,an energy,a necessity to act.it is a need for mastery,intellectuality and creativity, 
  which grows from the need to make sense of the world ,to understand the world and to create MY world.
  <p>"Self-awareness, emotional and intellectual balance, and an appreciation of the people in your life are the foundation-stones 
    of a life well lived" - Sietze Vanderheide!<p>I am fueled by my passion for learning and understanding the nuances of automation and programming languages 
My hunger for knowledge and determination to turn information into action makes me unique and distinctively outstanding.
I believe that mindfulness in the workplace is key to success - a tenet I live out through my interests in painting, learning new technology, photography and cooking.
